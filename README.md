## yt-dlp
quite possibly one of the best pieces of software out there.

### [Installation](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#installation)  
#### MacOS (homebrew)<br>
``brew install yt-dlp ffmpeg``

#### Linux <br>
``sudo curl -L https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest/download/yt-dlp -o /usr/local/bin/yt-dlp``<br>
run the following to make it executable ``sudo chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/yt-dlp ``<br>
``sudo apt install ffmpeg``<br>
OR<br>
``sudo dnf install ffmpeg``

#### Windows <br>

Run the Linux commands and you're set
